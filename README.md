# Smart-Wardrobe
A smart wardrobe makes suggestions on what to wear based on the latest trends and events on your calendar. You can also manage your clothes from anywhere using a mobile application. In this project, our goal is to put together a set of technologies into a system that could be used to aid the user in the planning of their clothes.
